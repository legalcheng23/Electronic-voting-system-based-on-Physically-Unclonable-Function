## Abstract

The electronic voting system offers a solution to these problems by automating the voting process, reducing costs and improving efficiency. However, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of electronic voting remains a significant challenge. Our project addresses this by integrating Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) technology into the electronic voting system. PUF technology enhances security by making the system unpredictable and non-replicable. This system architecture comprises voting, counting, and verification modules, each functioning independently to minimize interdependence and meet various verification needs. By utilizing PUF technology, our proposed system aims to provide a stable, secure, and efficient electronic voting process, ensuring voter confidence and data protection.
